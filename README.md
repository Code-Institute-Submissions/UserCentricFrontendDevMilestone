<h1>Karen Kinsella's Portfolio</h1>

The idea behind my project was two-fold. To build a portfolio detailing my interests, skills and work history whilst also directly showcasing my frontend development skills. I wanted to be able to provide prospective clients and employers with an example of my frontend skills, as well as providing them with an insight into me, what I enjoy and what I've worked on in the past. Along with a quick and easy way to get in touch with me via the contact form. 

<h2>UX</h2>

My project, my portfolio, is intended for prospective clients and employers to gain a deeper understanding of who I am, what interests me and my work history. As well as providing a first-hand example of my work, the project itself. My three page project clearly and neatly lays out an About Me section, my Work History section and a Contact section. I have also added the option for prospective employees and clients to download a copy of my CV, should this be their preferred method. 

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

I build my project based off of two User Stories: a prospective _client_ and a prospective _employer_. 

As a prospective client, when I come to Karen Kinsella's Portfolio, I want to be able to see first-hand her frontend development skills. I want to be able to see a tangible webpage that she has deisgned and built herself so that I can assess her skills based off the criteria I am looking for when hiring a developer to work on my projects with me.

As a prospective employer, when I come to Karen Kinsella's Portfolio, I want to see Karen's previous employment history. I want to gain an understanding of her skills and interests and a little bit about her as a person, so that I can assess her overall skills and culture fit against my hiring criteria for certain roles.

<h2>Features</h2>
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features

The navigation bar at the top of my portfolio allows users to switch between the separate pages of my site by giving them an easy navigational click option.

The large "Karen Kinsella - Portfolio" and image header tells users what the purpose of my site is. 

The main body section on the About Me page allows users to gain an understanding of what I do, what my interests are and why they should work with me by providing them with some details and points about myself. 

The main body section on the Work History page allows users to gain an understanding of my current and previous work history by outlining the details of my career to date.

The form on the Contact page allows users to get in touch with me regarding prospective projects and jobs by have them provide their name, email and a short message and submitting them through.

The email section of the footer provides users with my email address which allows them to contact me directly.

The download CV section of the footer provides users with the option of downloading my CV directly by having them click the download icon.

The social section of the footer allows users to visit my social profiles by having them click the social icons. 

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
Another feature idea I would love to implement further down the line would be direct links to my past work and projects so that prospective clients and employers could gain an even better perspective of my work.
  
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<li>HTML: https://html.com/. Used to build the skeleton structure of my portfolio.</li>
<li>CSS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS. Used to style my portfolio.</li>
<li>Bootstap: https://getbootstrap.com/. Used to make my project responsive and mobile first and to add additional styling.</li> 
<li>Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/. Used to add icons to my portfolio.</li>

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

<h3>JQuery</h3>
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

<h3>Testing</h3>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h3>Deployment</h3>
In order to deploy my project to my hosting platform of choice, GitHub Pages, I went to the settings tab within my UserCentricFrontendDevMilestone project and scrolled down to the GitHub pages section. I then toggled the "source" to "master" which provided me with the following link to my published site: https://karenk11.github.io/UserCentricFrontendDevMilestone.

Acknowledgements
I received inspiration from this project from the Code Institute's Mini Project with Bootstrap 4. I have mirrored some elements from this project, including the styling of the navigation bar and the footer, along with the contact form and CV download option. I have styled these to suit the look, feel and ultimate goal of my project.
